# Security

Inyon gives whoever signs in to the hub a shell on every connected machine, as the user the
agents run as. Treat the hub like an SSH jump host.

## How it is meant to be deployed

- **Keep the hub private.** It binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Reach it over a private network
  (Tailscale, NetBird, WireGuard, your LAN) or put it behind HTTPS with a reverse proxy. Don't
  expose plain HTTP to the internet.
- **One strong password.** The first visit creates it, with the setup code the hub prints. The hub
  stores only a scrypt hash. Sign-in attempts are rate limited per address and in total. Sessions
  are signed, HttpOnly cookies, and the API only accepts changes from the hub's own origin.
- **Only its own names.** The hub doesn't answer browsers that reach it under a public domain it
  wasn't told about (`INYON_ALLOWED_HOSTS`), so a web page can't point its own domain at your
  hub (DNS rebinding) and use it from your browser.
- **Laptops connect out, not in.** Machines running `inyon` open an outbound connection
  to the hub. Nothing on them listens for connections, so you never open SSH on a laptop. Each
  machine gets its own random token, the hub stores only its SHA-256, and removing the machine
  revokes it. A token no machine has used stops working after a day. `inyon` refuses to send its token over plain HTTP unless the hub is on a
  private address.
- **Servers can use SSH.** The hub uses your existing `ssh` config, keys and known hosts. It never
  stores SSH keys.

## The Android app

The app is its own hub, so whoever holds the unlocked phone can reach your servers, the same as
with a terminal app that has your keys.

- **Host keys are pinned.** The app shows a server's fingerprint before the first sign-in and
  stores the one you trust. A different key later stops the connection until you confirm it.
- **Secrets stay on the phone.** The app's ed25519 key, passwords and pasted keys live in
  EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android Keystore). Android backups are off for the app.
- **Nothing in between.** The app connects straight to each server over SSH. No relay or hub sees
  the traffic.

## Laptops paired with `inyon pair`

A paired phone gets a shell on the laptop as the user running `inyon`, the same as SSH.

- **The pairing code is the secret.** It holds a one-time code that works for 10 minutes and for
  one phone. Don't share a screenshot of it. Pairing again or `inyon forget` revokes a phone.
- **End-to-end encrypted.** Phone and laptop run Noise IK (X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, SHA-256).
  The phone already knows the laptop's key from the code, so a tunnel, relay or network in between
  can't read or change the traffic, or stand in for the laptop. The laptop only lets in phone keys
  it has paired.
- **The tunnel is public, the listener isn't open.** The Cloudflare quick tunnel gives the laptop
  a public address, but it only reaches the link's listener on `127.0.0.1`, which answers nothing
  until the handshake proves a paired phone. `--lan` also listens on the local network.
- **Addresses are signed.** The laptop publishes where it can be reached as a pkarr record signed
  by its own key. The record names addresses only; it says nothing about you or your sessions.
- **Keys on the laptop** live in `~/.inyon/node/` (`identity.json`, `phones.json`), readable only
  by you. The phone derives its link key from its own ed25519 key in the Android Keystore.

## What Inyon changes on a machine

Only if you turn on the Claude integration: it writes `~/.inyon/hook.sh` and
`~/.inyon/statusline.sh`, registers them in `~/.claude/settings.json` (backed up first), and
keeps your original status line in `~/.inyon/statusline.orig`. Turning it off restores both.
If Antigravity CLI is installed, it does the same for agy: `~/.inyon/agy-statusline.sh` goes into
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` (backed up first), your own agy status line is kept in
`~/.inyon/agy-statusline.orig`, and turning the integration off restores it.
If the integration disappears from `settings.json` (say, a sync script replaced the file), Inyon
puts it back, at most once every ten minutes. Turning the integration off stops that.
A session that was already running when its settings were replaced keeps ignoring
`settings.json`, so Inyon also adds its status line to that project's
`.claude/settings.local.json`. It does this only when the project has no status line of its own,
and it adds the file to `.git/info/exclude` so git never sees it. Inyon keeps a list of these
files in `~/.inyon/project-statuslines` and removes the line from each one when you turn the
integration off.
Uploads go to `~/.inyon/uploads` and are deleted after a retention period you choose.
The hook log holds your prompts, so `~/.inyon` and what the scripts write there are readable only
by you.

## What Inyon reads

For Claude plan limits, the hub runs a short script on the machine that reads Claude Code's
access token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or the macOS Keychain) and asks
`api.anthropic.com` for the account's usage, as `/usage` does. The token is passed to `curl` on
stdin, so it never appears in the process list, and it never leaves that machine. Only the
percentages and reset times come back to the hub.
