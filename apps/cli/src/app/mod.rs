//! The Inyon app on Windows: `inyon-app.exe`, a program without a console that owns everything
//! Inyon runs in the background there. It starts the link and the hub connection as its own
//! children (inside a Windows job, so they end with it, crash or not), shows the Inyon icon in the
//! notification area exactly while one of them runs, and opens the Inyon window. A second start
//! hands over to the one already running.
//!
//! What's here works the same everywhere and is tested on every system: the record of what the
//! app runs (~/.inyon/node/app.json), the requests the inyon command leaves for it (a folder it
//! reads twice a second, so a command over SSH reaches the app on the desktop too), when a job that
//! stopped is started again, and the words the tray and `inyon status` use. The Win32 side is in
//! [`win`].
