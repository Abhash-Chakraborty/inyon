# Adds this machine to an Inyon hub: gets the inyon command from the hub and runs its connection
# to the hub in the background, as the current user.
# Usage: INYON_TOKEN=<token> INYON_SUMS_SHA256=<sha256> sh install.sh <hub-url>
# (the hub's "Add a machine" command does this; `sh -s -- <hub-url> <token>` still works)
# The token comes from the environment so it doesn't show in the process list. With
# INYON_SUMS_SHA256 set, the hub's list of checksums must match it, and the program its line.
# INYON_HUB_CERT is the sha256 of a certificate the hub made itself (setup's LAN choice): the
# downloads can't check it and don't need to, being checked against INYON_SUMS_SHA256, and
# `inyon join` trusts only that certificate for the token.
