//! The hub in Rust: the Bun hub's HTTP server (index.ts and its routes) on inyon-core, the same
//! records, routes, answers, cookies and checks, so the web app, the phone app and machines
//! connect to it as they did to the Bun hub. `inyon` runs it, by default from 0.21 and only it
//! from 0.23, when the Bun hub was removed.
//!
//! Everything the hub keeps lives on one thread with one current-thread tokio runtime, the
//! listener included; see `server` for why.

// the API itself, shared with the phone app
