//! Port of features/pages.ts: the sites agents make (Blueprint plans, mockups) listed from
//! ~/.inyon/pages.json and served from this machine's disk under `/v/<token>/<path>`.
//!
//! inyon-core's `features::pages_core` holds the rules both hubs share (tokens, paths, headers);
//! this file adds what only a running hub has: the list file, the epochs that revoke links,
//! progress summaries, the API the app calls, and the `/v/` answer. The list file is the source of
//! truth. `inyon pages add` and Blueprint's publish script write it with no hub running, and the
//! hub reads it again whenever it changes.
//!
//! Threading. The core thread checks the token and resolves the path (with `tokio::fs`, whose
//! reads run on the blocking pool); the answer for a file leaves the core carrying only its path,
//! and the axum handler streams it (`file_body`), so a multi-MB image never holds up the core.
