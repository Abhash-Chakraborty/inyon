// How sessions are organised (from 0.24): pins, parking, snoozes, tags and notes on sessions,
// projects that gather sessions by folder, and what the hub does for them on its own: messages sent
// later, idle agents put to sleep, sessions closed once done, and saved prompts. The hub owns it, so every device (phone, browser,
// desktop app) shows the same order. The TypeScript side is in packages/protocol/src/index.ts.
//
// A session here is a pane, as the overview lists it, found again by the anchors its mark keeps
// (see [`SessionMark`]); the hub matches marks to live panes and the apps join them by `host` and
// `pane` while `live` is set.
