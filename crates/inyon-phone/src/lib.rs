//! Inyon's core in the phone app and in the browser copy, as wasm: inyon-api's routes and the
//! app's sockets on the browser's event loop, with the app's storage and `fetch`. The web app
//! loads it as @inyon/phone (see apps/web/vite.config.ts); it replaced the TypeScript core, which
//! was removed in 0.23, with the same `startPhone`.
