title: Pages
description: Open the plans and mockups your agents build as pages in the app, on your phone or desktop, each one sandboxed away from your sign-in.
---

From 0.20 a site an agent makes, such as a [Blueprint](skills.md#blueprint) plan with its mockups and progress board, opens inside Inyon under **Pages**. You don't run a server or copy a link around: the agent adds the folder once, and the page is in the app on every device you use.

## How a page gets there

An agent with the Blueprint skill does this on its own when it finishes a site. It runs one command, and you can run the same command for any folder with an `index.html` in it:

```sh
inyon pages add ./private/plans/my-plan --name "My plan"
```

It answers with where the page sits in the app:

```
"My plan" is in Inyon: Pages > abhash-arm > custom-tmux
Open it in the app at /pages/local/my-plan
```

`inyon pages` lists the pages on a computer and `inyon pages rm <slug>` takes one off the list. Adding the same folder again is safe and keeps its place. The folder stays where it is, and the app shows its files as they are now, so a page an agent keeps editing is always current. [The inyon command](cli.md#pages) has every option.

In the app, **Add a folder** does the same: pick the machine, type the folder's full path (starting with `/`, or a drive letter on Windows) and a name.

From 0.22.3 a page also shows where you work with the agent that made it. When a reply has the page's `/pages/…` link in it, the page shows as a card under the reply; tap it to open the page. A session's side panel (the **Activity** sheet on a phone) gets a **Pages** tab when the session has pages: those in its project, and those in folders under the one it runs in, on the same machine.

## Pages on your other computers

From 0.22 the hub also shows the pages on the computers joined to it, such as a Windows laptop, and on servers it reaches over SSH that have `inyon` installed. Run `inyon pages add` on that computer, or use **Add a folder** and pick it, and the page shows under that computer's name. Both the hub and the computer need 0.22 or later; an older computer's pages don't show until you update it.

The computer's own `inyon` reads the files and sends them to the hub, which checks every request by the same rules as for its own pages: no names starting with a dot, nothing a symlink leads to outside the folder. A page whose computer is offline doesn't open until it's back. From 0.22.3, while you have Pages open, the computer tells the hub when a page changes (it looks every 2 seconds), the hub keeps the files it already fetched until something in that folder changes, and a single file can be up to 64 MB. A computer with an older `inyon` is asked for its list at most every 15 seconds, and sends files of up to 8 MB. The hub's fallback in Bun (`INYON_HUB_IMPL=bun`) shows its own computer's pages only.

## On a phone

**Pages** is the second tab, between **Overview** and **+**. Its badge counts pages that changed since you last opened them. The list is grouped by machine, then by project: the folder's git repository, or the repository's main folder when the site sits in a worktree. Each card shows the page's name, a bar with how many tasks are done out of how many, what the agent is on now and when that board was last updated. The bar, the line and the time come from the site's `progress.json`, so a page without one shows only its name and when it was added. The hub reads it only when it's a plain file of up to 1 MB, not a symlink. A page you haven't opened since it changed has a dot. From 0.22.4 a task done on a board also comes as a [notification](notifications.md#what-youre-told-about) that opens the page, so you hear "3 of 12 done" without opening the plan.

Tap a card to open the page full screen. The bar on top has:

- **Back**, which returns to the list. The phone's own back button does the same, even after you've clicked around inside the page.
- The machine's name, a menu of the other pages on that machine and a way to open the machine.
- **⋯** with **Reload**, **Plan**, **Mockups** and **Matrix** when the site has them, and **Open in browser**. **Reload** opens the page with a new link. Picking a part always loads it, also the one already ticked, which takes you back after the page's own links moved you somewhere else.

Under the bar, a line says **Sandboxed page: never sign in here**. It stays on screen, so a page can't pass itself off as the app asking for your password.

If the phone loses a hub for a moment (a weak signal, the VPN dropping, the hub restarting), its pages stay on the list, shown as offline, and an open page stays on screen with **Can't reach *hub* now** under the bar. Both catch up when the hub answers again. A hub that answers but refuses the phone, because the phone was forgotten there, is different: its pages leave the list and the app says ***hub* forgot this phone** until you pair it again.

Long-press a card, or use its **⋯**, for **Open**, **Open in browser**, **Revoke links**, **Show folder** and **Remove**. **Show folder** lists the folder's path, the machine, the project and which agent added the page.

The Android app reaches pages through a hub. With only computers paired directly over the phone link, the tab says **Pages open through a hub**. Tap **Pair a hub** there, or pair one under **Computers**, and its pages appear. With several hubs paired, you see all their pages together.

## On a desktop

**Pages** sits in the sidebar between **Machines** and **Settings**, with the number of pages, or of changed pages when there are any. The screen has the list on the left as a tree of machines and projects, with a filter (press `/` to jump to it), and the open page on the right. Right-click a row for the same menu as on a phone. Clicking the open page's row again opens it with a new link, as **Reload** does.

Above the page:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| The path | Machine, project and page, so you know which copy you're looking at |
| **Plan**, **Mockups**, **Matrix** | Jump between a Blueprint site's parts, when it has more than one. A click always loads the part, also the one already selected |
| **Fit**, **Phone**, **Tablet**, **Desktop** | Show the page filling the pane, or at 390 × 844, 820 × 1180 or 1440 × 900, scaled down to fit |
| Reload | Load the page again, with a new link |
| Open in new tab | The page on its own in a browser tab, with a new 12-hour link |
| **⋯** | **Revoke links**, **Copy folder path**, **Show folder** and **Remove** |

A machine's own page lists its pages too, under **Pages on this machine**.

## Links and removing

The app opens each page with a link the hub signs for that page alone. A link lasts 12 hours. The app makes a new one every time you open a page or press **Reload**, and again an hour before it runs out, while the page is on screen or as soon as you come back to it. If the hub doesn't answer then, the app tries again after a minute, then waits twice as long each time, up to 10 minutes, while the page stays on screen. The app counts those 12 hours on its own clock from when the hub answered, so a phone whose clock is off still renews in time. **Open in browser** and **Open in new tab** make a new link each time, so a tab works for 12 hours from when you opened it. Open the page from the app again for a fresh one.

- **Revoke links** ends every link made for that page so far: tabs on other devices, links you copied, and the one on screen, which the app replaces at once.
- **Remove** takes the page off the list, and its links stop working. The folder and its files stay on the machine. The message that confirms it has **Undo** for a few seconds.

Changing the hub's password ends the links of every page, and forgetting a phone ends the links it made.

## What a page can't do

An agent wrote the page, and an agent can be talked into writing anything, so Inyon treats every page as a stranger's website:

- **It can't act as you.** The page runs in a sandbox, and the browser treats it as a site of its own. It never sees your sign-in, can't call Inyon to read your sessions or type into them, and can't read anything the app keeps on your device.
- **It can't load from the internet.** Scripts, styles, fonts, pictures and data have to be files in its own folder, linked with relative paths. A font from Google Fonts or a script from a CDN won't load, so keep them in the folder.
- **It can't see its folder's private files.** Names starting with a dot, such as `.git` or `.env`, are never served, and neither is anything a symlink leads to outside the folder.
- **It can't keep things.** The browser gives it no cookies and no storage, so a page that tries to save settings gets an error instead.

A page can still run its own scripts, handle its forms in those scripts, open links in a new window and offer files to download, which is what a plan page needs. [Security](security.md#pages) has the details.

## What a page can still do

The sandbox keeps a page away from your sign-in. It can't keep a page off the internet:

- **It can reach the internet without you seeing it.** No browser lets Inyon block every way out yet. A page's script can open a WebRTC connection, make the browser look up a name in DNS, move to another address or open a window, and nothing on screen has to change.
- **What it can carry out** is anything the agent that wrote it could read, and anything you type into the page. An agent whose sandbox has no network but can read your disk could copy a key or a token into the page's folder, and the page would send it from your browser.

So treat a page you didn't check like a link from a stranger:

> **Warning:** Never type a password, token or key into a page. Inyon never asks you to sign in inside a page. A page opened in its own tab shows your hub's address in the address bar, because pages are served on the hub's own port. That doesn't make it the hub's sign-in screen. A separate address for pages is planned.

For the same reason, a session's **Preview** tab won't show Inyon's own address. It says **Not shown here**, because a preview of the app could act as you. Open agent-made pages under Pages instead.

## When a page won't open

| You see | What to do |
|---|---|
| ***machine* is offline** | The hub's computer is off or out of reach. **Try again** once it's back |
| **Can't reach *hub* now** under the bar, or **The hub is out of reach** | The phone's last check with that hub failed. The page stays as it was and catches up when the hub answers. Check the phone's connection or VPN |
| ***hub* forgot this phone** | The hub refused the phone (it was forgotten on the hub), so its pages left the list. Pair the phone again from the hub |
| **This page is gone** | It was taken off the list on that machine. Add the folder again if you still want it |
| **Couldn't open "*name*"** | The app couldn't get a link from the hub; the reason is under it. **Try again** |
| **Not found** inside the page | The page's folder was moved or deleted, or a link inside the page points at a file that isn't there. `inyon pages` on that computer says when a folder is gone; add it again from its new place |
| **~/.inyon/pages.json isn't a page list Inyon can read** | The file isn't valid JSON, isn't a plain file (a named pipe, say) or is bigger than 4 MB. Fix it or delete it, then try again. A symlink to a real list is fine |
| **The hub can't write in ~/.inyon** when adding or removing a page | The hub's user can't write to `~/.inyon` or remove a `pages.json.lock` left behind there. Make sure both belong to the hub's user, then try again |
| **Couldn't revoke the links**, because the hub couldn't write to its data folder | The hub's disk is full or read-only. The old links stay closed only until the hub restarts. Free some space, then revoke again |
| **Link expired** inside the page | An old link, or the page's links were revoked. Press **Reload**, or open the page from the list again |
| A blank or unstyled page | It loads something from the internet. Copy those files into the folder and link them relatively |
