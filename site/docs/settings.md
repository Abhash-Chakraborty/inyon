description: Every setting in the app, what it does and its default.

Settings live on the **Settings** tab. Display settings are saved per device; settings about machines and uploads are saved where they apply.

## Appearance

| Setting | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Theme | Light, Dark, Auto | Auto (follows the system) |
| Match the agent inside sessions | On, Off | On: a session takes its agent's colours and logo |
| Reply font | Auto, Serif, Sans, Mono | Auto: each agent's own reply font |
| Tool calls in chat | Everything, Compact | Everything |
| Haptic feedback | On, Off | On |

Under reduced motion (a system setting), nothing slides or moves; sheets and menus only fade.

## Agents

Where each agent is installed (*On laptop, server*), the command that starts it, and whether its sessions open as a chat or in the terminal.

From 0.22, **Add an agent** below them saves a command of your own with the agent it works like, and it shows up in **New session**. Right-click it, or use its **⋯** menu, to edit or remove it. See [Your own agents](agents.md#your-own-agents).

## Companion

From 0.22, on the hub's web app: start the [companion agent](companion-agent.md) with **Claude Code** or **Codex**, then **Open** its chat or **Stop** it. If its agent quits, **Start again** and **Turn off** take the place of the buttons. A hub on Bun says it has no companion.

## Live numbers

**Restart sessions that stop reporting.** If a session's live numbers stop updating, Inyon reconnects or restarts it by itself.

## Uploads and clipboard

| Setting | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Delete uploads after | 1, 7 or 30 days, Never | 7 days |
| Largest file | 25, 100 or 500 MB | 100 MB |
| Keep at most | 500 MB, 1 GB, 5 GB, No limit | 1 GB |

Uploads are stored on each machine in `~/.inyon/uploads`. The machine's page shows how much space they take, with buttons to clean older ones or delete them all.

From 0.21, **Agent temp files** below the machines opens [Temp files](temp-files.md): the pasted images, screenshots and scratch folders agents leave on each machine.

From 0.17 the hub tidies every machine by itself about every six hours, and again when a machine comes back online: it deletes uploads past their age, then the oldest ones while the folder is over **Keep at most**. A file whose upload broke off keeps a `.part` ending and is deleted after an hour, so a half-sent file never looks finished. Computers paired only with a phone tidy their own uploads the same way, with the rules the hub last used there (7 days and 1 GB if there never was one).

## Notifications

**Allow**, **Send a test**, and *When an agent finishes*. On Android, also **Stay connected** and **Battery limits**. See [Notifications](notifications.md).

## Computers or Machines

A shortcut to the list. The app calls them *Computers*; a hub calls them *Machines*.

From 0.22 a hub adds **Machines can message agents** below the list. With it on, an agent on a joined machine can use [`inyon send`](cli.md#sessions-and-messages) to give agents on your other machines a message, which goes in once each is free. It's off until you turn it on. Listing machines, sessions and pages from a joined machine needs no switch.

## On a hub

- **Other devices.** The hub's address with a copy button, and how to open it in a phone's browser.
- **Paired devices.** From 0.20: **Show the code** to pair the Android app, **Pair a companion app** for an app like Legato (from 0.20.2 with **Copy pairing link**), the paired phones, each with **Forget**, and the companion apps with their permissions. A companion's menu (⋯, or a right-click) has **What it can do** and **Remove**. See [Companion apps](companions.md).
- **Account.** **Change password** (8 characters or more; signs out your other browsers) and **Sign out**.

## On the Android app

- **Hubs.** The hubs this phone is paired with, each with **Forget**.
- **This phone's key.** The phone's SSH public key, and the command that adds it to a server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. See [A server over SSH](android.md#a-server-over-ssh).

## Updates

What's installed and whether a newer version exists, with **Check now**:

- The Android app checks for a new release once a day and shows **Download** when there is one.
- A hub shows *Update available* with **Update**; see [Updating a hub](hub.md#updating).
- A browser copy reloads to its newest version.

## About

The version and build, the Android app's version, how the terminal is drawn, and **Copy version details** for a bug report. **How Inyon works** opens these docs (from 0.17; before, it opened the GitHub page). **Support Inyon** opens [Abhash's GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/Abhash-Chakraborty) (from 0.16.1). Inyon is free and MIT licensed, so this is only for people who want to chip in.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | Does |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl K` / `⌘ K` | Search and jump to a session |
| `Alt N` / `⌥ N` | New session, even while typing a message (from 0.16; not in the terminal) |
| `N` | New session, when you aren't typing |
| `Enter` / `Shift Enter` | Send / new line |
| `Alt Enter` / `⌥ Enter` | [Hold the message](sessions.md#holding-a-message-until-the-agent-is-free) until the agent is free (from 0.22) |
| `Esc` | Stop the agent (with an empty message box), close a sheet or menu |
| `↑` `↓`, `Enter`, `Tab` | Move through and pick from menus, `/` and `@` lists |
| Any key | Focus the message box (on a computer) |
| `Ctrl V` / `⌘ V` | Paste into the terminal |

On Android, the back button closes the top sheet first, then goes back a page. A long press on a card opens its menu. On a computer, right-click for the same menus; see [Right-click menus](overview.md#right-click-menus).
