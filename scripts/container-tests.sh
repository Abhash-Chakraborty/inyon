# Installs inyon in fresh Linux containers from a mock of this release, sets up a hub, and
# upgrades real 0.12.0 and 0.17.6 installs to it. The release's inyon-engine-* files are copies of
# inyon (scripts/engine-copies.sh), which those old versions fetch as they update. Needs docker and
# minisign (apt-get install minisign / brew install minisign); nothing else is installed on this
# machine.
#
#   scripts/container-tests.sh                 builds the command (cargo, static musl) for this
#                                              machine's processor first
#   INYON_DIST=<dir> scripts/container-tests.sh  takes inyon-linux-<arch>[.gz] from <dir> (CI)
#   INYON_TEST_SYSTEMS="alpine upgrade" …       runs only those (ubuntu debian alpine fedora hub
#                                              upgrade upgrade-0.17)
#
# The release is served from a container on a network with no way out, so a test that reached
# the website or GitHub would fail. Fresh installs read it the way the website serves it (/download,
# with latest.json); the 0.12.0 program in the upgrade test reads it the way GitHub does, as
# installs from before the website still do. The downloads from GitHub are those old programs,
# kept in ~/.cache/inyon-tests. The mock's SHA256SUMS is signed with apps/cli/tests/keys/test.key,
# and the containers get that key's public half as INYON_SIGNING_KEY, which get.sh and the
# command take instead of the release key when downloads come from somewhere else.
